# edgecast_origin (Resource)
Please use the Edgecast API for retrieving specific IDs available for Services, Access Modules, and Delivery Regions.
A future version of this provider may provide Terraform data sources for these.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/edgecast_origin/resource.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_origin" "example" {
  
}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_origin.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID:MEDIA_TYPE_ID
```
|                |                                                                  |
|:---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NUMBER` | The account number the origin ID is associated with. |
| `ID`             | The origin ID to import.                                     |
| `MEDIA_TYPE_ID` | The media type ID of the cname to import.                        |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
