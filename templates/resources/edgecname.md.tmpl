# edgecast_edgecname (Resource)
Please use the Edgecast API for retrieving specific IDs available for Services, Access Modules, and Delivery Regions.
A future version of this provider may provide Terraform data sources for these.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/edgecast_edgecname/resource.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}


## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_edgecname" "example" {
  
}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_edgecname.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID   
```
|                 |                                                                  |
|:----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ACCOUNT_NUMBER  | The account number the edge cname ID is associated with. |
| ID | The edge cname ID to import.                                     |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
