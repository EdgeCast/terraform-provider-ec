# edgecast_edgecname Resource
Use the `edgecast_edgecname` resource to create and manage an edge CNAME configuration. An edge CNAME configuration is a key component for delivering content through our CDN using a user-friendly URL. 

-> You may manage an existing edge CNAME configuration by importing it as a resource.

Setting up delivery through our CDN involves:
* Creating a customer origin group that identifies a data source for your content (e.g., your web servers).

 [Learn more.](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Origin_Server_-_File_Storage/Customer-Origin-v2.htm)
* Creating an edge CNAME configuration that points your hostname to an origin (e.g., a customer origin group).

* Creating or updating a CNAME record through your DNS service provider. This step is essential for directing requests to our CDN.

* If you require delivery over HTTPS, then you will need to also provision a TLS certificate through our Certificate Provisioning System.

## Import Resource
Manage an existing edge CNAME configuration through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_edgecname" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_edgecname" "sample_edge_cname" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach an edge CNAME configuration to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_edgecname.<RESOURCE> <ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:<EDGE_CNAME_ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<EDGE_CNAME_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the desired edge CNAME configuration. You may retrieve a list of edge CNAME configurations and their system-defined IDs through our [REST API](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/Edge_CNAMEs.htm).

    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_edgecname.sample_edge_cname 0001:123456
->Upon running the above command, a resource for that edge CNAME configuration will be recorded in the state file.
