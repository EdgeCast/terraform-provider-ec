# edgecast_dns_group (Resource)
**NOTE: Route DNS feature support via Terraform is currently in Beta status.**

Create a DNS load balancing or DNS failover group. 

A load balancing configuration allows our authoritative DNS servers to 
distribute requests across various servers or CNAMEs.

A failover configuration establishes a primary and backup relationship between 
two servers or domains. Our authoritative name servers will send all traffic to 
the primary server/domain until it fails a majority of its health checks. At 
which point, all traffic will be redirected to the backup server/domain.

For more information, please visit the Route Help Center
