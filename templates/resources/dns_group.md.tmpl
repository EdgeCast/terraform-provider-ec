# edgecast_dns_group (Resource)
**NOTE: Route DNS feature support via Terraform is currently in Beta status.**

Create a DNS load balancing or DNS failover group. 

A load balancing configuration allows our authoritative DNS servers to 
distribute requests across various servers or CNAMEs.

A failover configuration establishes a primary and backup relationship between 
two servers or domains. Our authoritative name servers will send all traffic to 
the primary server/domain until it fails a majority of its health checks. At 
which point, all traffic will be redirected to the backup server/domain.

For more information, please visit the Route Help Center
https://docs.whitecdn.com/dns/index.html#Route/Welcome_to_the_Help_Center.htm

## Example Usage

{{ .SchemaMarkdown }}

## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_dns_group" "example" {

}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_dns_group.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID:GROUP_PRODUCT_TYPE
```
|                 |                                                                   |
|:----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NUMBER`  | The account number the DNS group ID is associated with. |
| `ID` | The DNS group ID to import.                                       |
| `GROUP_PRODUCT_TYPE`  | The group product type of the DNS group to import.               |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
