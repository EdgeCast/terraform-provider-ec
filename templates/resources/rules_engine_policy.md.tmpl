# edgecast_rules_engine_policy Resource

Use the `edgecast_rules_engine_policy` resource to deploy a Rules Engine policy. A policy defines how specific types of requests are processed by the CDN. 

-> You may manage an existing Rules Engine policy by importing it as a resource.

## Format

Define a policy in JSON using the [Add Policy endpoint's request body parameters](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/REv4/Add-Policy.htm#Request). 

!> You may only define your policy using the above parameters. Including other parameters (e.g., `created_at` or `updated_at`), such as those returned by the Get Policy endpoint, may generate an error.

## Import Resource
Manage an existing Rules Engine policy through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_rules_engine_policy" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_rules_engine_policy" "sample_policy" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach a policy to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_rules_engine_policy.<RESOURCE> <ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:<POLICY_ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<POLICY_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the desired Rules Engine policy. You may retrieve a list of policies and their system-defined IDs through our [REST API](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/REv4/Get-All-Policies.htm).

    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_rules_engine_policy.sample_policy 0001:123456
->Upon running the above command, a resource for that policy will be recorded in the state file.
