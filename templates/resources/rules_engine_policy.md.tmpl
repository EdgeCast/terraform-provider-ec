## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_rules_engine_policy" "example" {

}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_rules_engine_policy.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID:PORTAL_TYPE_ID:CUSTOMER_USER_ID
```
|                  |                                                                   |
|:-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NUMBER`   | The account number the rules engine policy ID is associated with. |
| `ID`               | The rules engine policy ID to import.                                      |
| `PORTAL_TYPE_ID`   | The portal type ID of the cname to import.                        |
| `CUSTOMER_USER_ID` | The customer user ID of the edge cname to import.                  |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
