# edgecast_waf_custom_rule_set Resource
Use custom rules to tailor how WAF identifies malicious traffic. This provides added flexibility for threat identification that allows you to target malicious traffic with minimal impact to legitimate traffic. 

-> Apply a custom rule set to your traffic by adding it to a [Security Application Manager](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/SAM.htm) configuration.

-> You may manage an existing custom rule set by importing it as a resource.

## Import Resource
Manage an existing custom rule set through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_waf_custom_rule_set" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_waf_custom_rule_set" "sample_custom_rule_set" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach an custom rule set to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_waf_custom_rule_set.<RESOURCE> <ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:<CUSTOM_RULE_SET_ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<CUSTOM_RULE_SET_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the desired custom rule set. You may retrieve a list of custom rule sets and their system-defined IDs through our [REST API](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/Web-Security/Get-All-Custom-Rule-Sets.htm).

    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_waf_custom_rule_set.sample_custom_rule_set 0001:123456
->Upon running the above command, a resource for that custom rule set will be recorded in the state file.
