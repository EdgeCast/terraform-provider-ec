# edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set (Resource)
Please use the Edgecast API for retrieving specific IDs available for Services, Access Modules, and Delivery Regions.
A future version of this provider may provide Terraform data sources for these.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set/resource.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set" "example" {
  
}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID   
```
|             |                                                      |
|:------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NUMBER` | The account number of the WAF bot rule set to import. |
| `ID`          | The WAF bot rule set ID to import.                |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
