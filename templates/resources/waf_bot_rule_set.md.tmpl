# edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set Resource

Use bot rules to require a client (e.g., a web browser) to solve a challenge before resolving the request. WAF blocks traffic when the client cannot solve this challenge within a few seconds. Basic bots typically cannot solve this type of challenge and therefore their traffic is blocked. This prevents them from scraping your site, carding, spamming your forms, launching DDoS attacks, and committing ad fraud.

-> Apply a bot rule set to your traffic by adding it to a [Security Application Manager](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/SAM.htm) configuration.

-> You may manage an existing bot rule set by importing it as a resource.

## Import Resource
Manage an existing bot rule set through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set" "sample_bot_rule_set" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach a bot rule set to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set.<RESOURCE> <ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:<BOT_RULE_SET_ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<BOT_RULE_SET_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the desired bot rule set. You may retrieve a list of bot rule sets and their system-defined IDs through our [REST API](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/Web-Security/Get-All-Bot-Rule-Sets.htm).

    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_waf_bot_rule_set.sample_bot_rule_set 0001:123456
->Upon running the above command, a resource for that bot rule set will be recorded in the state file.
