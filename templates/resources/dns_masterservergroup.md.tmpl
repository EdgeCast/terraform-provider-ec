**NOTE: Route DNS feature support via Terraform is currently in Beta status.**

A master server group allows you to group and manage master name servers from a 
single location instead of from each secondary zone group or secondary zone.

For more information, please visit the Route Help Center

## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_dns_masterservergroup" "example" {

}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_dns_masterservergroup.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID
```
|                 |                                                                   |
|:----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NUMBER`  | The account number the master server group ID is associated with. |
| `ID` | The master server group ID to import.                             |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
