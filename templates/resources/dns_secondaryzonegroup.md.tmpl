# ec_dns_secondaryzonegroup (Resource)
**NOTE: Route DNS feature support via Terraform is currently in Beta status.**

The purpose of a secondary zone group is to define one or more secondary zones. 
A secondary zone will be created for each zone defined in a secondary zone 
group. These secondary zones will be populated with:

* A default set of records that identify our vanity name servers.
* The set of records associated with the original zone. These records are 
retrieved via a full zone transfer (AXFR).

For more information, please visit the Route Help Center
