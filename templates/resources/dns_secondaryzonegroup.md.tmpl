# edgecast_dns_secondaryzonegroup (Resource)
**NOTE: Route DNS feature support via Terraform is currently in Beta status.**

The purpose of a secondary zone group is to define one or more secondary zones. 
A secondary zone will be created for each zone defined in a secondary zone 
group. These secondary zones will be populated with:

* A default set of records that identify our vanity name servers.
* The set of records associated with the original zone. These records are 
retrieved via a full zone transfer (AXFR).

For more information, please visit the Route Help Center
https://docs.whitecdn.com/dns/index.html#Route/Administration/Secondary_Zone_Group_Administration.htm

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/edgecast_dns_secondaryzonegroup/resource.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_dns_secondaryserverzonegroup" "example" {

}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_dns_secondaryserverzonegroup.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID
```
|                 |                                                                  |
|:----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NUMBER`  | The account number the secondary server group ID is associated with. |
| `ID` | The secondary server group ID to import.                         |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
