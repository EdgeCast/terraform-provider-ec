# edgecast_waf_scopes Resource
A Security Application Manager configuration:

* Identifies the set of traffic to which it applies by hostname, a URL path, or both.
* Defines how threats will be detected through access rules, rate rules, bot rules, custom rules, and managed rules.
* Identifies how the above rules are enforced on rate limited requests or threats . 
* Keeps your applications secure while auditing new access rules, custom rule, and managed rule configurations.

## Import Resource
Manage an existing Security Application Manager configuration through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_waf_scopes" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_waf_scopes" "sample_sam" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach an Security Application Manager configuration to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_waf_scopes.<RESOURCE> <ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:<SAM_ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<SAM_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the desired Security Application Manager configuration. You may retrieve a list of Security Application Manager configurations and their system-defined IDs through our [REST API](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/Web-Security/Get-All-Scopes.htm).

    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_waf_scopes.sample_sam 0001:123456
->Upon running the above command, a resource for that Security Application Manager configuration will be recorded in the state file.
