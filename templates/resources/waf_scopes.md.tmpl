## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/edgecast_waf_scopes/resource.tf"}}


## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_waf_scopes" "example" {

}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:

```shell
terraform import edgecast_waf_scopes.example ACCOUNT_NUMBER:ID
```
|                 |                                                                   |
|:----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ACCOUNT_NUMBER`  | The account number the waf scope ID  is associated with. |
| `ID` | The ID of the waf scope to import.                                |

As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
