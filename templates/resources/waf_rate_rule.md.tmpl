# edgecast_waf_rate_rule Resource
A rate rule restricts the flow of site traffic with the intention of:

* Diverting malicious or inadvertent DDoS traffic.
* Preventing a customer origin server from being overloaded.

[Learn more.](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Rate-Rules.htm)

Requests that exceed the rate limit may be dropped, redirected to another URL, or sent a custom response. The type of enforcement action that will take place is determined by the [Security Application Manager](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/SAM.htm) configuration that leverages it.

-> You may manage an existing rate rule by importing it as a resource.

## Import Resource
Manage an existing rate rule through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_waf_rate_rule" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_waf_rate_rule" "sample_rate_rule" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach an rate rule to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_waf_rate_rule.<RESOURCE> <ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:<RATE_RULE_ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<RATE_RULE_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the desired rate rule. You may retrieve a list of rate rules and their system-defined IDs through our [REST API](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/Web-Security/Get-All-Rate-Limits.htm).

    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_waf_rate_rule.sample_rate_rule 0001:123456
->Upon running the above command, a resource for that rate rule will be recorded in the state file.
