# edgecast_customer (Resource)
Please use the Edgecast API for retrieving specific IDs available for Services, Access Modules, and Delivery Regions.
A future version of this provider may provide Terraform data sources for these.

## Example Usage

{{tffile "examples/resources/edgecast_customer/resource.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Import

To import a resource, create a resource block for it in your configuration:

```terraform
resource "edgecast_customer" "example" {

}
```

Now run terraform import to attach an existing instance to the resource configuration:


```shell
terraform import edgecast_customer.example CUSTOMER_ID
```
|              |                                  |
|:-------------|----------------------------------|
| `CUSTOMER_ID` | The customer ID to import |


As a result of the above command, the resource is recorded in the state file.
