## Import Resource
Manage an existing bot manager through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_waf_botmanager" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_waf_botmanager" "sample_group" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach a origin group to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_waf_botmanager.<RESOURCE> <CUSTOMER_ID>:<ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<CUSTOMER_ID>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<CUSTOMER_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the bot Manager. 
    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_waf_botmanager.sample_botmanager ABCD:123456
-> Upon running the above command, a resource for that bot manager will be recorded in the state file.
