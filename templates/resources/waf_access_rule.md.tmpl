# edgecast_waf_access_rule Resource
Use the `edgecast_waf_access_rule` resource to create an access rule. An access rule identifies legitimate traffic and threats according to the request's traits (e.g., ASN, cookie, country, and IP address). You may define [whitelists](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Access-Rules.htm#Whitelists), [accesslists](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Access-Rules.htm#Accesslists), and [blacklists](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/Access-Rules.htm#Blacklists) for each desired category. 

-> You may manage an existing access rule by importing it as a resource.

-> Apply an access rule to your traffic by adding it to a [Security Application Manager](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/#Web-Security/SAM.htm) configuration.

## Import Resource
Manage an existing access rule through Terraform by importing it as a resource. Perform the following steps:
1. Insert an empty resource block within your resource configuration.

        resource "edgecast_waf_access_rule" "<RESOURCE>" {
          
        }
    **Example:**

        resource "edgecast_waf_access_rule" "sample_access_rule" {
          
        }
1. Run the following command to attach an access rule to your resource configuration.

        terraform import edgecast_waf_access_rule.<RESOURCE> <ACCOUNT_NUMBER>:<ACCESS_RULE_ID>
    * `<RESOURCE>` - Replace this term with the name of the resource defined in step 1.
    * `<ACCOUNT_NUMBER>` - Replace this term with your customer account number. Find your account number in the upper right-hand corner of the MCC.
    * `<ACCESS_RULE_ID>` - Replace this term with the system-defined ID assigned to the desired access rule. You may retrieve a list of access rules and their system-defined IDs through our [REST API](https://developer.edgecast.com/cdn/api/index.html#Media_Management/Web-Security/Get-All-ACLs.htm).

    **Example:**

        terraform import edgecast_waf_access_rule.sample_access_rule 0001:123456
->Upon running the above command, a resource for that access rule will be recorded in the state file.
