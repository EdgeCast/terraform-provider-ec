# Verizon Media Platform Provider

A Terraform provider for the Verizon Media Platform. Follow the table of contents for resource documentation.

## Security

For those users who have been granted specific permission(s) by an account administrator to use the Verizon Media Platform, each usage requires the inclusion of a user specific token. Tokens can be created or revoked by the user via the Portal to ensure token security.

## Logging
You can set the `TF_LOG` and `TF_LOG_PATH` environment variables to enable logging for Terraform. See the [official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html) for details.

For example, on MAC OS, running the following two commands will enable logging **for your current terminal session**:
```
export TF_LOG=TRACE
export TF_LOG_PATH=/somewhere/on/your/hard_drive/convenient/terraform.log
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "ec" {
    api_token = var.api_token
    ids_client_secret = var.ids_client_secret
    ids_client_id = var.ids_client_id
    ids_scope = var.ids_scope
    ids_address = var.ids_address
    api_address = var.api_address
    api_address_legacy = var.api_address_legacy
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- **account_number** (String) Account Number to use when only managing a single customer's resources. If managing multiple customers, this parameter should be omitted.
- **api_address** (String) The base url of Verizon Media resource APIs. Omit to use the default url. For internal testing.
- **api_address_legacy** (String) The base url of legacy Verizon Media resource APIs. Omit to use the default url. For internal testing.
- **api_token** (String) API Token for managing the following resources: Origin, CNAME, Customer, Customer User
- **ids_address** (String) The base url of Verizon Media identity APIs. Omit to use the default url. For internal testing.
- **ids_client_id** (String) OAuth 2.0 Client ID for managing the following resources: Rules Engine Policy
- **ids_client_secret** (String) OAuth 2.0 Client Secret for managing the following resources: Rules Engine Policy
- **ids_scope** (String) OAuth 2.0 Scopes for managing the following resources: Rules Engine Policy
- **partner_id** (Number) Partner ID to impersonate. If using PCC or MCC credentials, this parameter will be ignored.
- **partner_user_id** (Number) Partner User ID to impersonate. If using PCC or MCC credentials, this parameter will be ignored.

**Note for Verizon Media internal users:** `partner_id` and `partner_user_id` are required in addition to your credentials.

## Variable File Usage
There are two ways to set your data. One is to set your configuration data directly in a `main.tf` file.
For local testing, this works fine. **However, if you plant to use the provider for multiple environments, we recommend terraform.tfvars files.**
The example variable file below contains variables that can be used for the Verizon Media Platform Terraform Provider.

```terraform
partner_info = {
    #for pointing to staging environment, leave null to default to production
    api_address = null
    # You must provide either an API Token or IDS credentials, but not both
    api_token = null
    ids_client_secret = null
    ids_client_id = null
    ids_scope = null
}
