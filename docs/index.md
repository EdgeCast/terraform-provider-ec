# Edgecast Terraform Provider

Edgecast allows you to securely deliver content to your customers. Use the Edgecast Terraform provider to manage and provision your CDN configuration, security, and DNS.

## Prerequisites
Use of the Edgecast Terraform provider requires:
* An Edgecast customer account in good standing.
* Authentication through either an API token or REST API (OAuth 2.0) client credentials. This requirement varies according to the resource being provisioned.

## Basic Setup
We will now cover how to set up the Edgecast Terraform provider using the [Terraform CLI](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) version 0.14 or later. Perform the following steps:
1. Create and define a **.tf** configuration file for the Edgecast Terraform provider. 
    1. Click `Use Provider` to display a template for the Edgecast Terraform provider.
    1. Copy and paste the above template into your **.tf** configuration file.
    1. Define each desired variable within a variable block. 

        !> Do not define sensitive information (e.g., API credentials) within a variable block. One method for securely defining variables is to set variable values from within a **.tfvars** file (e.g., terraform.tfvars) that is excluded from source control. 

        For example, you can define the `token` variable within a variable block.

            variable "token" {
                description = "REST API Token" 
                type = string
                sensitive = true
            }
    1. From within the `edgecast` provider block, define how Terraform will authenticate to our service. 

        For example, you can set the **api_token** argument to the variable defined in the previous step:
            
            provider "edgecast" {
                api_token = var.token
            }
    1. Save your changes.
1. Create a **terraform.tfvars** file and set your variables within it.

    !> Exclude this file from source control, since it contains sensitive information. 

    1. Set each desired variable. 

        For example, you can set the `token` variable to your REST API token value.

            token = "12345467890abcdefghijklmnopqrst"
    1. Save your changes.
    1. Configure your repository to prevent this file from being included in source control by adding it to your **.gitignore** file.
1. Create and define a **.tf** configuration file for the desired resource(s).
    1. Create a **.tf** configuration file. You may add all of the desired resources to this configuration file or create resource-specific configuration files.
    1. From the documentation for the desired resource, copy and paste the desired example resource into your **.tf** configuration file.
    1. Modify the resource block as needed.
    1. Save your changes.
1. Initialize Terraform and install the latest version of the Edgecast provider by running the following command from Terminal:

        $ terraform init
1. Create a plan for your resources by running the following command:

        $ terraform plan
1. Apply your plan by running the following command:

        $ terraform apply
    Review the plan and then type **yes** to apply it.
    Terraform will use the Edgecast provider to update your configuration to match the configuration defined within your plan.
