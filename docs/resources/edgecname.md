- **name** (String) Sets the name that will be assigned to the edge
					CNAME. It should only contain lower-case alphanumeric
					characters, dashes, and periods. The name specified for
					this parameter should also be defined as a CNAME record

					for a CDN origin server or a customer origin server. 
					Valid values: 
					-1: Indicates that you would like to create an
					edge CNAME for our CDN storage service,
					CustomerOriginID: Specifying an ID for an existing
					customer origin configuration indicates that you would
					like to create an edge CNAME for that customer origin

### Optional

- **dir_path** (String) Identifies a location on the origin server. This
					string should specify the relative path from the root
					folder of the origin server to the desired location. Set
					this parameter to blank to point the edge CNAME to the
					root folder of the origin server.
- **enable_custom_reports** (Number) Determines whether hits and data transferred
					statistics will be tracked for this edge CNAME. Logged
					data can be viewed through the Custom Reports module.
					Valid values are:
					0: Disabled (Default Value).
