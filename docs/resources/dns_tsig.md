# edgecast_dns_tsig (Resource)
**NOTE: Route DNS feature support via Terraform is currently in Beta status.**

Transaction Signature (TSIG) allows our name servers to authenticate 
communication to your master name server(s). This requires that you register a 
TSIG key and then assign it to a master name server. 
A brief description for each component of a TSIG key is provided below.


| Component | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| TSIG Alias | A label that provides a brief description for a TSIG key. This label is solely used to identify a TSIG key when assigning it to a master name server. |
| Key Name | Identifies the key on the master name server and our Route name servers. This name must be unique. |
| Key Type | Identifies the cryptographic hash function used to generate the key value. Our TSIG implementation supports MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-2 (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512). |
| Key Value | Identifies a hash value through which our name servers will be authenticated to a master name server. |

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "edgecast_dns_tsig" "tsig1" {
  account_number = "A1234"
  alias = "Test terraform keys"
  key_name = "key1"
  key_value = "HFNASHDJJKQWHKJ1234"
  algorithm_name = "HMAC-SHA512"
}
```
