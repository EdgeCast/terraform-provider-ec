# edgecast_dns_zone (Resource)
**NOTE: Route DNS feature support via Terraform is currently in Beta status.**

The Managed (Primary) or Secondary DNS module allows the creation and management 
of zones. A zone defines a set of data through which our authoritative name 
servers can provide a response to DNS queries. This data can be found in the 
records associated with your zone. In addition to record administration, zone 
management also allows the definition of load balancing and failover 
configurations for address and CNAME records within that zone.

For more information, please visit the Route Help Center
https://docs.whitecdn.com/dns/index.html#Route/Administration/DNS_Zone_Management.htm
