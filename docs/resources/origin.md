## Schema

### Required

- **directory_name** (String) Identifies the directory name that will be 
				assigned to the customer origin configuration. This alphanumeric 
				value is appended to the end of the base CDN URL that points to 
				the customer origin server. Note: A protocol should not be 
				specified when setting this parameter. Examples: 
				"www.example.com:80","10.10.10.255:80","[1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8]:80"
- **host_header** (String) Defines the value that will be assigned to the 
				Host header for all requests to this customer origin 
				configuration. A host header is especially useful when there are 
				multiple virtual hostnames hosted on a single physical server or 
				load-balanced set of servers.
- **load_balancing_scheme_http** (String) Determines how HTTP requests will be 
				load balanced across the specified hostnames/IP 
				addresses. Valid values: "RR" for Round Robin and 
				"PF" for Primary and Failover.
- **load_balancing_scheme_https** (String) Determines how HTTPS requests will be 
				load balanced across the specified hostnames/IP 
				addresses. Valid values: "RR" for Round Robin and 
				"PF" for Primary and Failover.
- **media_type_id** (Number) Identifies the platform on which the customer 
				origin configuration resides. Valid values are:
				3: HTTP Large, 8: HTTP Small, 14: ADN
- **network_configuration** (Number) Determines how hostnames associated with this 
				customer origin configuration will be resolved to an IP 
				address.

### Optional

- **account_number** (String) Account Number for the customer if not already 
				specified in the provider configuration.
- **follow_redirects** (Boolean) Indicates whether our edge servers will respect a 
				URL redirect when validating the set of optimal ADN gateway 
				servers for your customer origin configuration.
- **id** (String) The ID of this resource.
- **origin_hostname_http** (Block Set) Identifies the HTTP origin servers, load 
				balancing configuration, and origin precedence if applicable to 
				the load balancing type specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--origin_hostname_http))
- **origin_hostname_https** (Block Set) Identifies the HTTPS origin servers, load 
				balancing configuration, and origin precedence if applicable to 
				the load balancing type specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--origin_hostname_https))
- **shield_pop** (Block Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--shield_pop))
- **validation_url** (String) Indicates the URL to a sample asset. A set of 
				optimal ADN gateway servers for your customer origin server is 
				determined through the delivery of this sample asset.

### Read-Only

- **http_full_url** (String) Indicates the CDN URL for HTTP requests to this 
				customer origin server.
- **https_full_url** (String) Indicates the CDN URL for HTTPS requests to this 
				customer origin server.
- **use_origin_shield** (Number) Indicates whether Origin Shield has been activated 
				on the customer origin. Valid values are:
				0: Disabled, 1: Enabled

### Nested Schema for `origin_hostname_http`

Required:

- **name** (String) Identifies the hostname/IP 
				address of an origin server that will be 
				associated with the customer origin 
				configuration being created.

Optional:

- **is_primary** (Number) Indicates whether a 
				particular hostname/IP address is the 
				primary one for HTTP requests.
				Valid values are:
				0: Is not the primary one.
				1: Is the primary one.
- **ordinal** (Number) Indicates the position in 
				the ordered list for the current 
				hostname/IP address. This position is 
				primarily used by "Primary and Failover" 
				load balancing mode to determine which 
				hostname/IP address will take over when 
				a hostname/IP address higher on the list 
				is unreachable.


<a id="nestedblock--origin_hostname_https"></a>
### Nested Schema for `origin_hostname_https`

Required:

- **name** (String) Identifies the hostname/IP 
				address of an origin server that will be 
				associated with the customer origin 
				configuration being created.

Optional:

- **is_primary** (Number) Indicates whether a 
				particular hostname/IP address is the 
				primary one for HTTP requests.
				Valid values are:
				0: Is not the primary one.
				1: Is the primary one.
- **ordinal** (Number) Indicates the position in 
				the ordered list for the current 
				hostname/IP address. This position is 
				primarily used by "Primary and Failover" 
				load balancing mode to determine which 
				hostname/IP address will take over when 
				a hostname/IP address higher on the list 
				is unreachable.


<a id="nestedblock--shield_pop"></a>
### Nested Schema for `shield_pop`

Optional:

- **pop_code** (String) Defines an Origin Shield configuration 
							for this customer origin. This configuration is 
							defined through a three or four-letter code.
